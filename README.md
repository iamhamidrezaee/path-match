> Connecting Cornell CIS underclassmen with graduating seniors for personalized career guidance and course planning.

## 📊 The Problem

Underclassmen in Cornell's CIS Information Science and ISST majors face challenges accessing effective career guidance. 

**The Numbers:**
- ~140 undergraduates earned Information Science or ISST degrees in 2023
- **Nearly 10%** were unemployed or seeking employment at graduation
- *Source: Cornell University reports, 2023*

### Current Challenges

The existing advising system, facilitated primarily through Zoom meetings with a limited number of CIS career advisors, falls short in several ways:

- **Outdated Resources** — Information doesn't reflect current industry trends
- **Generic Guidance** — Advice is too broad to address specific career questions  
- **Late Realization** — Students discover they've taken the wrong courses too late in their undergraduate career
- **Industry Gap** — Advisors lack up-to-date experience with evolving tech sectors

---

## 🎯 Our Mission

We aim to **improve access to personalized, relevant career guidance** for undergraduate students in Cornell's Information Science and ISST majors. 

By connecting students with up-to-date advice, resources, and peer experiences that better reflect the realities of the tech and information fields, we empower them to make informed academic and career decisions early in their undergraduate journey.
